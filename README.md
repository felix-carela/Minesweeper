# Minesweeper

My game is Minesweeper, a game that challenges your logic and deduction skills. The game is played on a grid of cells, where some cells contain hidden bombs. The objective is to reveal all cells that are safe (not containing bombs) while avoiding the bombs. When a cell that is not a bomb is revevealed it will show a number from 0 to 8, the number being the amount of bombs next to the cell. Through logic you can calculate where the mines are at, and then flag them by right-clicking. If you reveal a cell with a bomb, the game is over.

## Technologies Used

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game.
- `main.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
